# Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Movie Recommendation

This project implements a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) using PyTorch Geometric to predict user-movie ratings. The model leverages GraphSAGE convolutions to learn node embeddings and a classifier to predict interactions between users and movies.

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tqdm

Install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install torch torch-geometric scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm
